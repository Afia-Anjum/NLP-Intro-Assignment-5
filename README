Place the assignment-5.py file in the directory which contains the directory "a5_data_students" with the train file "trainBBC.csv", test file "testBBC.csv" and evaluation file "evalBBC.csv".

Run the program. It will generate two .csv files, namely "output_testBBC.csv" and "output_evalBBC.csv". These files will be generated in the same directory as the assignment-5.py file.

Furthermore, the program will also print the following to the console:

- the data split indices as a results of cross-validation
- the average accuracy scores per parameter
- the best parameters selected as a result of cross-validation
- the accuracy score on testBBC.csv
- the confusion matrix
- the macro precision and recall scores
- the micro precision score
- the (avg.) macro precision score
